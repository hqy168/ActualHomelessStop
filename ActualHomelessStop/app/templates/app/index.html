    <h3>Homeless Stop is co-hosting with Keys to Change on Thirst Aid, their summer-long heat relief campaign.</h3>
    <p>Together, we are collecting bottled water and other heat relief items for those who need them most.</p>
    <p>Each summer, thousands of individuals experiencing homelessness rely on Key Campus, a collaborative space where many organizations (including us!) come together to provide life-saving services. During the hottest months, water is essential, but it is not always easy to access.</p>
    <p>That’s where you come in..</p>
    <p>Join us on September 6th at the Harrison Gate at Key Campus to donate. We’re collecting bottled water, new socks & underwear, hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, lip balm, travel-size toiletries, cooling towels, and lightweight summer clothing.</p>
    <p>Every donation helps protect lives in the heat; it’s one of the easiest, tangible ways to help.</p>
